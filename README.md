# Resume-Screening-App

## Context 

In today's fast-paced recruitment landscape, companies receive a huge number of applications for each job opening. Manually screening each resume is time-consuming and inefficient. To streamline this process, a resume screening app can be a valuable tool.

## Goals
Key Benefits of a Resume Screening App:
* Efficiency: Quickly filters resumes based on specific criteria, like skills and experience.
* Accuracy: Reduces the risk of overlooking qualified candidates.
* Data-Driven Insights: Provides valuable analytics on applicant pools.
* Scalability: Handles large volumes of applications with ease.

## Data Description

The dataset is obtained from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehaanbhawal/resume-dataset).

The dataset includes over 2,400 resumes in two formats:
* Text Format: Each resume is provided as a string of text, containing the raw content without any formatting.
* PDF Format: The original PDF versions of the resumes are stored in a separate folder. The PDF files are organized into subfolders based on their respective job categories. The filename of each PDF matches the unique ID associated with that resume in the CSV file.

The CSV file provides information about each resume, including:
* ID: A unique identifier for the resume, also used as the filename for the PDF.
* Resume_str: The text-only version of the resume.
* Resume_html: The HTML structure of the resume, preserving formatting and layout information.
* Category: The specific job category for which the resume was used.
